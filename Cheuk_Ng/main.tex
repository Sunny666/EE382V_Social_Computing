\section*{Q3}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{q3-graph.png}

By using similar data from figure 23.5, plot the graph using rank against voters, and each point in the graph is an alternative for the corresponding voter. 

There is still single peak for each voter, but the pattern used by the Median Voter Theorem doesnâ€™t exist in this setting. Thus, we can no longer find the median individual favorite for a potential group favorite. 

If we switch to Majority rule, each alternative has a peak from different voter, which produces the preference that we saw in the Condorcet Paradox.
